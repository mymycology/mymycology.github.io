			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>Mycology is a recent field compared to other sciences. The main scientific obstacle to understanding fungi was the need for microscopes, which was developed in the seventeenth century and refined in the nineteenth century, and pure culture techniques, which came about in the nineteenth century. Many other barriers prevented the study of fungi, as well as the acceptance of findings: mycophobia that both drove people away from interacting with fungi and prevented them from acknowledging scientific discoveries; the unrecognition of mycology as a legitimate science, and thus little research due to the lack of organizations and funding; the orthodoxy, conservatism, and deference to authority within the scientific community; and the plasticity, variety, and complexity of fungi as organisms. There are some important things to note. First, with each discovery, it often took a century or longer for the findings to be accepted by the scientific community due to the aforementioned reasons. Additionally, Europe was the primary sphere for mycology until the 20th century, when it shifted to North America. Finally, most of mycology's research and discoveries are thanks to the work of amateurs, people who were often unfunded, following their own interests, and even socially ostracized for their work. Below is an outline of each time period and its mycological discoveries and understandings:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>3rd century BCE – 15th century</b>: Not much knowledge of fungi comes about in this time period, but mushrooms are included in several early botanical writings, since they were understood to be plants. A few observers venture to classify mushrooms, mainly in categories of edible and poisonous. The invention of the printing press at the tail end of this period spreads superstitions and misunderstandings of fungi.</li>
				<li><b>16th – 17th century</b>: This period contains the first landmark of mycology: the observation of fungal spores. Additionally, the first microscope is invented, though rudimentary. There is a small uptick in mycological publications, including the first published book about fungi; these works set the foundation for future writings. Minor speculations on fungi's status as different from plants can be found.</li>
				<li><b>18th century</b>: Considered mycology's boom, there is an exponential rise in mycological writings within the century. What many deem the birth of mycology occurs: the publication of Pier Antonio Micheli’s “Nova plantarum genera." Fungi are proved to be autonomous organisms, and a binomial naming system is constructed that provides a foundation for categorization and studies. Several scientists ruminate on fungi's taxonomic status, especially with a rise in scientific research on lichen.</li>
				<li><b>19th century</b>: Mycology's boom continues and consists of heightened interest in fungi from both the scientific and cultural spheres, particularly in Victorian England. A major development is the disproval of spontaneous generation, the previously dominating understanding of fungi's creation. The period also establishes the pathogenicity of fungi on plants–fungi are the cause, rather than the result, of plant disease. The microscope becomes more refined, opening the door for a better understanding of microfungi. The end of the century sees research on mycorrhizae, demonstrating that fungi can form symbiotic relationships with plants, as opposed to their previous association with parasitism. Finally, fungi are generally accepted as heterotrophs within their own distinct group, though still within the plant kingdom; however, speculation about their taxonomic status increases.</li>
				<li><b>20th century</b>: The mycology field shifts its primary hub from Europe to North America, and new organizations, university departments, and research groups begin to grow. Medical and veterinary mycology experience a significant growth, especially after World War II and the discovery of penicillin. More attention is given to microfungi, particularly of poisonous nature, and the end of the century includes heightened research on psychedelics. As another major landmark, fungi are finally given their own taxonomic kingdom within the scientific community, and mycology becomes a separate science from botany.</li>
				<li><b>21st century</b>: The modern age, so far, comprises of a mycological revival in popular science and popular culture, mirroring Victorian interests. There is a rise in media, such as literature and film, that feature fungi, especially within the horror genre. Many scholars and laymen are interested in the concept of the Wood Wide Web and fungi's potential for the future.</li>
